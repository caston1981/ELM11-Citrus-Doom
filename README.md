Thanks to:

* [Fabien Sanglard's website](https://fabiensanglard.net/doomIphone/doomClassicRenderer.php) for the broad strokes of Doom's rendering
* [The Doom Wiki](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Entryway) for info on the Doom engine's level format and general rendering
* [Coder Space's python Doom engine](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-Level-Viewer) which I used as the basis for load doom's .wad into a microcontroller, and to understand texture mapping
* [Doom source code](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM/tree/master) for understanding roughly how it handles line-of-sight checks, and the very useful state list stored in info.c
* [SLADE](https://slade.mancubus.net/index.php?page=about) for telling what parts of a level are what and looking at sprites, and for basic map editing
* [Chocolate Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org/) for being a very good point of comparison for what my remake should be like
* [decino](https://www.youtube.com/@decino)'s [yellow Doom Mechanics videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYZp53E4M0t_1C8D_b_rAC_8AGYX8cWDB&si=x0TPLpT5qH4mPT6D) for general (mostly object-interation and enemy logic) info
* [Ultimate Doom Builder](https://ultimatedoombuilder.github.io/) for being a much less annoying map editor than Slade, used for settings map
* Friends for amoral support
